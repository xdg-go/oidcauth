## 2026-08-10 — Pass iss to the ForceApprovalIfNewUser callback

`ForceApprovalIfNewUser` changed from `func(sub string) bool` to
`func(iss, sub string) bool` (released as v0.2.0, a breaking change).
The original sub-only signature was chosen for minimalism: an `Auth`
instance is bound to a single issuer, so `iss` is constant per
instance and looked redundant. In practice that minimalism pushed
complexity into callers. The go-vue-app-template skeleton keys
accounts on the compound `(iss, sub)` pair — the only account key this
library's own README permits — so its store had to grow a sub-only
lookup (`HasUserSub`) with cross-issuer semantics no other caller
wanted, plus a standalone `sub` Mongo index solely because the
compound index cannot cover a sub-only query. Closing over the issuer
was possible but broke the clean method-value handoff
(`g.store.HasUser`) by forcing issuer config into the store or a
wrapper closure into auth wiring.

Passing the verified `iss` lets the callback mirror the storage key
directly: callers hand in a store method keyed on `(iss, sub)`, need
no extra index, and cannot false-positive across issuers on colliding
`sub` strings. The cost is one parameter that is constant per `Auth` —
accepted, same as `http.Request` carrying `Host` on a single-vhost
server. Revisit only if the option grows more callback shapes;
sub-only convenience wrappers are not worth the second signature.
